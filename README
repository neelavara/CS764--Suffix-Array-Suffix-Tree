There are two .cpp files:
1. suffix_array.cpp: This has implementation of construction of suffix array and then searching a pattern in it. Following are the steps for usage:
g++ suffix_array.cpp -o suffix_array
suffix_array <Name of Text File>

Ex: suffix_array SampleTextFile_10kb.txt
You will be prompted to then enter a pattern to search in the suffix array. If the pattern exists, then the index of its first occurence will be displayed. Enter "q" to quit.

2. suffix_tree.cpp: This has implementation of construction of suffix_tree and then searching a pattern in it. Following are the steps for usage:
g++ suffix_tree.cpp -o suffix_tree
suffix_tree <Name of Text File>

Ex: suffix_tree small_file.txt
The abve implementation works only for very small files. We have attached a small_file.txt for this. You will be prompted to enter a pattern to search in the suffix tree. In this part, we only display if the pattern exists or not. Enter "q" to quit.
